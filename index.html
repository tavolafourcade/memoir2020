              <p>I didn't know what to do with my life until I found the answer on Code. This book teached me what's necessary to think as a programmer. It makes me happy be able to understand others solutions and be able to build my own ideas. Now I know the sky is the limit and I'm very motivated to go for it!</p>

                      <p>Since 2016 I know I wanted to become a developer, but I kept quiting. On march 2020, i installed TikTok and, as crazy as it sounds, my motivation to go after my dream came outta there. I saw a lot of great developers and people who were wiling to provide us free resources and guides to help us study. Now i'm feeling very motivated and I've actually started Computer Science college on August.</p>
