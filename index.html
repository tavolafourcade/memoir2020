              <p>I didn't know what to do with my life until I found the answer on Code. This book teached me what's necessary to think as a programmer. It makes me happy be able to understand others solutions and be able to build my own ideas. Now I know the sky is the limit and I'm very motivated to go for it!</p>

              <p>In high intensity nature of the times we are currently in, I found my inner voice through better mental health. Coding is a creative pursuit, & can be explored to full potential with a calmer, more balanced state of mind. Be brave in the face of chaos, and keep doing your best. Take care.</p>
